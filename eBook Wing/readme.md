# E-Book Wing README

This was the first attempt to make a DIY device for reading books, but revision A had a couple of crucial design flaws. You can cut some traces and add some wires to make this board work, but more likely you'll want to use revision B, which can be found in [the Open Book repo](https://github.com/joeycastillo/The-Open-Book).
